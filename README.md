# p5-vj

A fast-switching p5js setup, well-suited for VJ's and video artists looking to use creative code. 

Heavily inspired by, and building on the work of RBVJ created by George Gally. Large sections of the code, and overall structure is unchanged from the original project here: https://github.com/GeorgeGally/rbvj. The original RBVJ project uses ThreeJS, and a custom creative coding library, which could be better suited for some workflows. Read the [medium article](https://medium.com/@radarboy3000/how-to-create-a-vj-engine-in-javascript-b63b7fb1c87b) to better understand the structure of this project.

p5-vj uses a similar overarching structure and design as RBVJ, but uses p5js instances.

All code here is open source, and contributions are always welcome.

This version also includes WebMIDI code intended to work with the Akai LPD8 controller.

Detailed documentation coming soon.
