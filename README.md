# p5-vj

A fast-switching p5js setup, well-suited for VJ's and video artists looking to use creative code. 

Heavily inspired by, and building on the work of RBVJ created by George Gally. Large sections of the code, and overall structure is unchanged from the original project here: https://github.com/GeorgeGally/rbvj. The original RBVJ project uses ThreeJS, and a custom creative coding library, which could be better suited for some workflows. Read the [medium article](https://medium.com/@radarboy3000/how-to-create-a-vj-engine-in-javascript-b63b7fb1c87b) to better understand the structure of this project.

All code here is open source, and contributions are always welcome. This project is just about functional, and things are very likely to break. *Use with caution.* 



## Documentation

p5-vj uses a similar overarching structure and design as RBVJ, but uses p5js instances. Instances are written slightly differently from regular p5 sketches. See the sample sketches in the folders and watch Daniel Shiffman's video on the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su792jEauZg

0-9 on the keyboard opens up each bank, and each letter A-Z references a sketch within the bank. The folder system in '/art' reflects this structure.

Further detailed documentation coming soon.



## Usage

Download the repository, and run using a local server. If you use Brackets, open the folder, and use Live Preview. Espresso has a similar function which creates a local server with a button-click.

Alternatively, use the Github Pages version: https://burnedsap.github.io/p5-vj/
